# Inventory Management with Pandas and Seaborn

## Introduction

This project uses Pandas and Seaborn in Python for managing and visualizing inventory levels over time.

## Files

- `inventory_data.csv`: Current inventory levels for various items.
- `new_inventory_data.csv`: Details about new inventory arrivals.

## Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

**Data Files**: Make sure the data files (inventory_data.csv and new_inventory_data.csv) are in the same directory as the notebook.

**Output**: The notebook generates a table showing inventory levels on a weekly basis for each item and a bar chart illustrating total monthly inventory levels.

**Results**
The notebook generates a table displaying inventory levels for each item on a weekly basis.
Additionally, a bar chart is produced, visualizing the total monthly inventory levels for all items.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the use of Pandas and Seaborn for effective inventory management and visualization. Feel free to customize and extend the code to fit your specific use case.
